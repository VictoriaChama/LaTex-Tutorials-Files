	\section{First Equations - Inline}
	
	This equation is inline $b = 5*4$.
	This equation is also inline $b = 5^4$.
	
	\section{With Floating Environment}
	

	\begin{equation}
	\label{equation_1}
	\alpha \,\, \leq  \,\, \beta \,\, \geq \,\, \rightarrow \,\, \text{ To add space at the begining and at the end of the document } \,\, \cup 
	\end{equation}
	
	
		% So if you do not want the equation number to be added for you use the \begin{equation*} environment which can be used by added the package amsamath
	\begin{equation*}
	5*4 = 20
	\end{equation*}
	
	This is the reference to the equation in the Text. See Equation ~\ref{equation_1}
	
	\section{Adding Multiple Arrays}
	Sometimes you want to add multiple arrays using one environment because they are similar. to do that use the begin{eqnarray} environment
	 
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{equation_2}
	5 + 5= 10 \\ 
	\label{equation_3}
	7 + 2 + 70 &= 867
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	This is Equation ~\ref{equation_2} and this is equation ~\ref{equation_3}. To reinforce alignment you can also use the AND sign and LaTex will try its best to realign based on the position of the AND symbol. You can also use 2 AND signs to add more reinforcement.
